    <h2> About </h2>
    <h3> I am a  social media specialist, design writer, and web designer based in San Francisco, CA. </h3>
    <h4>
    <p> Originally from the Bay Area, I attended Boston College where I earned her Bachelors in English in 2013. Immediately following graduation, I moved to Louisville, Kentucky, to pursue a Masters in Teaching at University of Louisville. During this time, I also taught 11th grade English in a Persistently Low Achieving public high school. After earning my Masters with high honors, I moved to Uppsala, Sweden to pursue teaching abroad. During this time in Scandinavia, I fell in love with design and media, prompting me to switch careers in the fall of 2017. Since then, I have worked for Dwell Magazine as their Social Media and Community Manager. </p>
